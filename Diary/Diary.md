Project started.

I'm inspired when I find tutorial with Hex map.(https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/)

But in my case, I want to make my own so I'll try with triangular tiles.

And today's work:

Blending colors with near tiles finished.

I'm nearly get tired of change hexagonal tile in tutorial found yesterday to triangular one, but finally I did it.

And it makes me skip filling between blendered tiles(because it doesn't have any gap!).

So today's work:

![blendered tiles](/Diary/Image/20181121_0.PNG)

Colors were put for visibility.

I realized that I must not skip bridging-filling between blendered tiles, so turned back to that.

And reform Tiles' coordinate calculation, value of enums, etc..

Finally I got this:

Throwed away blending but get elevation.

I don't need blending because triangular tile is only the part of hexagonal tile.

And they have to be seperated surely.

So I removed blending(actually space for blending) and use it for filling filler for elevation difference.

In addition to that, I added noise in shape of tiles.

It makes tiles more naturally.

today's temporal work:
